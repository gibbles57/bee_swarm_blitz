# Bee Swarm Blitz
A web-based deckbuilding roguelite game inspired by Bee Swarm Simulator, Balatro, and Slay the Spire.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Originally started as a resource calculator, but as I learned more about JavaScript I realized I can turn this into much more. My passion for video games along with the intricate mechanics behind BSS only fueled my dedication to this project. I was inspired by something I greatly enjoyed and decided put my own spin onto it, creating a similar, yet fundamentally different, experience.

## Technical Skills Learned:

This project was my first experience with asynchronous programming. I learned how to use Promises and the `await/async` functions.
This was my first major project, and required a lot more functions that I expected. Using inner functions within a few major functions for each aspect of the game helped keep my code organized and clean.
I needed a way to store information and functions within different types of cards, so I learned how to use classes in JavaScript and it was just the solution I needed.
My game was looking bland with just basic colors, and learning how to implement animations through CSS was a great way to spice it up a bit.
The most stubborn bug I had to deal with was regarding the animations placed upon a card while dragging it, in which dragging a card fast enough over two sections would apply the animations more than once. Even through rigorous testing, I was never able to figure out why this was happening. This forced me to adapt to find a new solution, which ended up working safer and more effective than the original.

## Personal Growth:

I've learned a lot about myself throughout this project, including my dedication to continue working through my classes at university. I thought I wouldn't have enough time once my classes began, yet I was able to balance my school and personal lives well enough so that I could.
The most important thing this project has taught me is that everything will take longer than expected. Whether that be through design, implementation, or testing, I would've never seen myself still working on this project to this day.
